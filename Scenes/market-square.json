  "sceneName": "Market Square at Sunset",
  "description": "The sun sets over the bustling market square, casting long shadows across the cobblestoned streets. Stalls are being packed up by weary merchants, their goods reduced to a few scattered items. The air is thick with the mingling scents of spices, fresh bread, and the tang of metal from a nearby blacksmith's forge. A soft hum of chatter and the occasional shout fade as the evening approaches, and lanterns begin to flicker to life, casting a warm glow on the fading day. Children chase each other through the thinning crowds, while a bard strums a lute on the corner, the melancholic tune drifting through the air.",
